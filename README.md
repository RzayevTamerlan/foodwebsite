# foodwebsite

<h1>My first vanilla JS project about food website.</h1>

This is my first vanilla JS project. 
In this project, I implemented dynamic user interaction with the site. Created a custom slider, an application submission form, a calorie rate calculator, a timer, 
interaction with the server (sending a completed form and receiving a menu of cards). I used a modular approach and built the project through Webpack. 
There are several modules and services that are eventually assembled into one JS file. I also included various additional npm modules. 
For example, this is babel, which helps to adapt the code for older browsers.
